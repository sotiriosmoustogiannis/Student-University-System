# Student-University-System
A tier 3 Java application where students, instructors and secretaries after authentication and authorization 
have specific functions.

Students are able to view their grades per courses, grades per semester and average.

Instructors are able to view a list of grades per course and post grades per course.

Secretaries are able to view course details (course title, semester, etc), assign courses to an instructor,
add/edit/delete courses and more.
